This game is a short experiment in emergent narrative.

It features turn-based tactical battles and traversal around a procedurally generated overworld. 
 - The worlds are generated using my own library (EmpiresCore), which I originally developed for a separate project.
 - All character portraits are also procedural.
 - You control a party of fighters fleeing your homes as a mysterious sickness spreads across the world. 
 - Survive as long as you can, recruit new allies and find new weapons to defend yourself.
 - The number of events, items and location types is somewhat limited, but there is enough variety to demonstrate some of the game's core ideas.

The game was last built with Unity 2020.2.1f1.

I completed this work in 2021 before starting at Second Impact Games. I created this repo so that the project can be more easily shared, but I may continue development in the future.
